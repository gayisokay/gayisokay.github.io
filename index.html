		<h1>#GayIsOkay</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This is a group dedicated to spreading the word that being part of the LGBTQ+ community is okay. Hence the name #GayIsOkay. It consists of a bisexual owner and a straight allied manager.</p>
		<h2>Bios</h2>
		<p>@AlphaZetta: I am a straight ally who fully supports the LGBTQ+ community because people should be able to love who they want. I also have a couple of LGBTQ+ family members.<br />
		@ZPgaming: I am a bisexual male that supports all forms of equality. I think that If you are gay/lesbian etc you should be accepted no matter what.</p>
		<h2>What we are about</h2>
		<p>We are about spreading the word that being lesbian, gay, transgender, transsexual, two-spirit, transsexual, queer, questioning and straight is okay. People should be able to love who they want to love. Not showing your true feelings can leave you sad, anxious and even depressed. We do not want that. Come out of the closet. It doesn't have to be to everyone at once. Baby steps, as they say.</p>
		<h2>Discord</h2>
		<p>Yes, we have a Discord server where you can talk to the owner and co-owner themselves and they will always respond. Find it <a href="https://discord.gg/Jbt8Wnu" style="text-decoration: none;">https://discord.gg/Jbt8Wnu</a></p>
